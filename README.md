# Tap-the-Ball
Post here some exmaples from my pet-project Tap the Ball.

Tap the ball is a hypercasual mobile game created by me and my mates.

The main mechanics is very simple - the ball moves diagonally. By tapping the screen, the player changes the direction of the Ball.
The goal is to avoid obstacles and set records.

Now the game has builds on android and ios devices.
